# 📘 Ridge and Lasso Regression

### *(L1 & L2 Regularization Techniques)*

## 🔍 Introduction

In machine learning, **regularization** is a technique used to prevent **overfitting** by adding a penalty to the model’s complexity.

When a linear regression model becomes too sensitive to training data, it may perform poorly on unseen data. Regularization helps by **constraining coefficient values**.

Two popular regularization methods:

* **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**
* **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**

---

# 🧠 Why Regularization is Needed

Linear regression models may suffer from:

✅ **Overfitting** – Model memorizes noise
✅ **Multicollinearity** – Highly correlated features
✅ **Large coefficients** – Unstable predictions

Regularization addresses these problems by penalizing large weights.

# 📉 Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

## ✅ Definition

Ridge regression adds an **L2 penalty** to the loss function:

[
Loss = RSS + \lambda \sum w^2
]

Where:

* **RSS** = Residual Sum of Squares
* **λ (lambda)** = Regularization strength
* **w²** = Squared coefficients

---

## ✅ Key Idea

👉 Shrinks coefficients **toward zero**, but
👉 **Never makes them exactly zero**

---

## ✅ Characteristics

✔ Reduces model variance
✔ Handles multicollinearity well
✔ Keeps all features
✔ Improves stability

---

## ✅ When to Use Ridge

Use Ridge when:

* Many correlated predictors
* All variables are potentially useful
* Want coefficient shrinkage, not elimination

---

# 📉 Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

## ✅ Definition

Lasso regression adds an **L1 penalty**:

[
Loss = RSS + \lambda \sum |w|
]

Where:

* |w| = Absolute value of coefficients

---

## ✅ Key Idea

👉 Shrinks coefficients
👉 Can force some coefficients to **exactly zero**

---

## ✅ Characteristics

✔ Performs **feature selection**
✔ Produces sparse models
✔ Removes weak predictors
✔ Improves interpretability

---

## ✅ When to Use Lasso

Use Lasso when:

* Dataset has many irrelevant features
* Feature selection is required
* Want a simpler, interpretable model

# ⚖️ Ridge vs Lasso

| Aspect            | Ridge (L2)                  | Lasso (L1)                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Penalty           | Sum of squared coefficients | Sum of absolute coefficients       |
| Coefficients      | Shrunk but not zero         | Some become exactly zero           |
| Feature Selection | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes                              |
| Multicollinearity | ✅ Good                      | ⚠️ Can select one among correlated |
| Model Complexity  | Medium                      | Simpler                            |

# 🎯 Role of Lambda (λ)

λ controls the penalty strength:

* **λ = 0** → Equivalent to Linear Regression
* **Large λ** → Strong shrinkage

Trade-off:

✔ Higher λ → Less overfitting
❌ Too high → Underfitting

---

# 📊 Intuition

**Without Regularization:**
Model may use extreme coefficient values → Overfitting

**With Regularization:**
Coefficients constrained → Better generalization

---

# ⭐ Practical Benefits

✅ Reduces overfitting
✅ Improves generalization
✅ Handles correlated features
✅ Controls model complexity
✅ Enables feature selection (Lasso)

---

# 🎓 Key Takeaway

> **Ridge regression controls model complexity by shrinking coefficients, while Lasso regression additionally performs feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero.**
